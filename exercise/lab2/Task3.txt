Communication cost analysis

================
Leader Election
================
In our implementation of the Leader Election algorithm we send three types of election messages.
For a start_election message, the cost is 2n-3 messages.
For a alive message, the cost is the same, meaning 2n-3.
For the victory message, the cost is n-1.
The total solution cost for n nodes is (5n-7).

=======================
Centralized Blackboard
=======================
Since we propagate only the new post and not the whole blackboard, then the cost of adding/deleting/modifying a message on the board depends on which server is propagating. There are two cases:
1) If the leader is the one to propagate - Cost per post is (#number_nodes - 1)
2) If any other server is propagating - Cost per post is (#number_nodes)

========================================
Pros And Cons of a Centralized Solution
========================================
Pros
Easy to implement.
It's more consistent.
Easy detachment of a node from the system.

Cons
One single central unit - One single central unit which serves/coordinates all the other nodes in the system.
Dependent failure of components - Central node failure causes entire system to fail. 
Bottlenecks can appear when the traffic spikes.
